**A powerful npm package to prevent typosquatting attacks by catching npm install <package_name> typos.**

# Features

- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Detects potential typosquatting attempts in package names.
- üß™ Provides suggestions for correct package names.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Integrates seamlessly with your existing npm workflows.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightweight and fast, averaging 10ms per package check.

# How it Works
Anti-typosquatting uses the [Levenshtein distance algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to calculate the similarity between the package that the user wants to install against the top 10000 npm packages (retrieved from [LeoDog896's latest npm-rank release](https://github.com/LeoDog896/npm-rank)).

The Levenshtein distance between two strings is calculated by finding the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other (operations being insertions, deletions, or substitutions). This is a perfect way to detect typosquatting attempts, as it can detect small differences between two strings that are caused by typos or misspellings.

Levenshtein distance algorithm's dynamic programming implementation has a time complexity of O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings being compared, so the algorithm is very fast and efficient. On average, the algorithm takes around 10ms to calculate the similarity between the package name and the top 10000 packages, making it a great choice for typosquatting detection.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install anti-typosquatting
```

To set up the alias, use the alias-setup.sh script (make sure to double check your bash config file path):

```bash
./src/alias-setup.sh
```

Lastly, add the following to your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "safe-install": "ts-node src/index"
  }
}
```

You can edit how aggressive the typosquatting detection is by changing the `TOLERATED_DISTANCE` variable in the `src/index.ts` file. The threshold is the maximum Levenshtein distance between the package name and the top 10000 packages that is considered safe. By default, the threshold is set to 2, but you can change it to any value you like. Higher, the value, the more aggressive the detection will be.

## How to Use
Every time you run `npm install`, anti-typosquatting will check if the package name is a potential typosquatting attempt. If it is, it will provide suggestions for the correct package name. If the package name is safe, the installation will proceed as normal.

If you would like to force-update the list of top 10000 packages, delete the top10000libs.txt file, and run npm install <any_package>
